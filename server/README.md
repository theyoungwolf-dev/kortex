# 🛠 Kortex Backend

This is the backend of **Kortex**, powering the GraphQL API, media proxying, Stripe integrations, and core business logic. Built in **Go**, it uses modern libraries like **Uber FX** for dependency injection, **Chi** for HTTP routing, and **Ent** as the ORM.

| Tool/Library | Purpose                                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Go**       | Primary language                                |
| **Uber FX**  | DI container + lifecycle management             |
| **Chi**      | HTTP router and middleware                      |
| **GQLGen**   | Codegen-based GraphQL schema & resolvers        |
| **Ent**      | ORM with GraphQL integration (entgql extension) |
| **Atlas**    | Database schema migrations                      |
| **Stripe**   | Payments & payouts via Stripe Connect           |
| **S3**       | Object storage for images and media             |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
go mod tidy
```

### 2. Generate Ent + GraphQL

```bash
# Run Ent codegen
go generate ./ent

# Run GQLGen
go generate ./graph
```

### 4. Run the server

```bash
go run main.go
```

The server will:

- Start the Chi HTTP server via `httpfx`
- Register routes from GraphQL, media, payments via FX modules
- Expose GraphQL endpoint at `/graphql` and Playground at `/playground`

## 📦 Uploads & Media

- **User-uploaded media**: uploaded directly to S3 via pre-signed URLs
- **Public access**: proxied through `/media/:id` for caching and stable URLs
- **Optimized delivery**: Enables use of `next/image` on the frontend

## 🧾 Payments

- Stripe integration via **webhooks**
- Stripe Connect used to handle affiliate payments

## 🔐 Authentication

- Auth is enforced via middleware in `auth/`
- Current user extracted from context, used in GraphQL resolvers

## 🧩 Modular Design (FX)

Each module (GraphQL, HTTP, media, storage, etc.) registers itself into the global Uber FX container, making it easy to:

- Add new features with scoped dependencies
- Start/stop lifecycle components cleanly via `fx.Hook`
